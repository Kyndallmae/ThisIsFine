# About

This application allows users to have an easy guide on different emergencies and natural disasters.

# Description

An app that educates users on emergency preparedness and provides resources for different types of emergencies.

# Challenges

With this project, we recognized that the vision we wanted to fully realize would require more time, research and more refined skills. We faced difficulties such as debugging, branches, and overall technical challenges with VS Code. As a team, our schedules varied so communication was difficult.

# Future Development

We would like to add more pages with different natural disasters and resources. Also, set up a donation collection to keep the sight up and running. As well as create a community board where people can connect and share advice and other resources.

# Motivation

Since weather and natural disasters vary by location, we wanted to have one location where anyone can search weather conditions, have information on emergency preparedness and be able to share up to the minute information all in one place.

# Success

We communicated superbly as a team. We all contributed with ideas, contributions, assisting each other with any issues that arose. We used multiple resources and overcame time consuming obstacles and outside distractions.
